How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

> It helps because it identifies the specific line of code to look at in more detail...allowing you to spot text differencess


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

> I can easily look up what I have done in the past and compare to where I am now to project some new ideas.
It helps me remember what I have learned.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

> automatic can create lots of versions that can be confusing. Manual lets me choose the "logical" time to commit...Something that makes sense.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

> because google is specific docs that aren't necessarily conneted with other docs..however, in development, you often have many separate docs that are connected
with each other...so it makes sense to logically commit them all at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

> the log helps me identify the specific commits...listing the overview of the changes and their specific id's...these ids enable me to compare specifically what has been changed
via red text for removed and light green text for added.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

> Well I can always go back without much issue and do this anytime i want


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

> setting up version control for my web work and apps
